## About this project
This presentation is created using the RevealJS HTML framework. You can find the documentation at [revealjs.com](revealjs.com). 

### Making changes

To make changes, simply edit `index.html`. The `index-sample.html` file contains some sample code to get started. It uses the `black.scss` theme, so if you need to make changes to the theme, make some edits to the CSS there.

To see your changes, either open the index html file in a browser, or `npm install` and `npm run start` to get it running on localhost:8000.

### Publishing changes

Make sure you have committer acccess to the repo so you can make edits! Anything on the master branch will be published on Sarah's GitHub via GitHub pages. You can view the current live version [here](https://sarahmacneill.github.io/cfg-feedback-project/#/).
